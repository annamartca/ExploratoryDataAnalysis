## Explorator Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the initial stage of data analysis that helps to summarize the main characteristics of the data enabling identification of patterns, relationships and deviations; often employing data visualization methods.The present EDA repository provides a collection of commands and scripts to learn how to investigate data sets, focusing on spatial proteomics.

# Key features

- **Descriptive statistics**
  - Calculate basic statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, to summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the data.

- **Data Visualization**
  -  Create plots and charts (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to visually explore the data and gain insights into its distribution, relationships between variables, and potential outliers.

- **Data Cleaning**
  - Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.

- **Correlation Analysis**
  - Examine the relationships between variables to identify potential associations.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**
  - Reduce the number of variables in the dataset while preserving its essential characteristics (e.g., Principal Component Analysis-PCA or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding-t-SNE).

- **Pattern Recognition**
  - Look for recurring patterns or clusters in the data using methods like cluster analysis.


## Why this Explorator Data Analysis approach?

- Written entirely in Python language.
- Targeted to beginners learning Python as each command or script has comments and source reference.

## Requirements & Installation

- Python 3.

- Any Integrated Development Environment (IDE) as PyCharm [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/] or Visual Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/].
